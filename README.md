# Dropshift

Inspired by Downshift, this library intends to provide solutions for people wanting to add accessible navigation dropdowns to their apps.

## Why not Downshift?
Downshift works primarily as a combobox, that is to say, a text input and a select input combined. As such it, at the very least, expects a list of items, from which one can 'select' an item. These behaviours collide with user expectations when dealing with a navigation dropdown. Link items should focus when tabbing through the page, unlike Downshift, which uses arrow-keys for item to item navigation. This library is meant for non-selectable items (actionable items) and does not intend to support complexities like nested dropdown lists.

              <button {...getToggleButtonProps()}>
                Menu
              </button>
              <nav {...getMenuProps()}>
              //...links here
              </nav>
            </Fragment>
          )
        }
      </Dropshift>
    )
  }
}
```
